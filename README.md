# lisbon

[![Release](https://github.com/arabesqueai/lisbon/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/lisbon/)

`lisbon` aims to be a drop-in replacement for `liblinear` which `scikit-learn` leaverages for linear classification problems, currently only supports L2-regularised hinge loss for binary classification by solving the dual problem (routine 3). The APIs follow `scikit-learn`'s `liblinear` wrapper and importing the Python library will monkey-patch `scikit-learn`'s svm library to use `lisbon` for the supported calculation.

```python
from sklearn import svm
import lisbon
```

and the following computations will use `lisbon` if supported. To switch back `lisbon.unload()` will swap back the original fit function.

Please see [`lisbon/__init__.py`](lisbon/__init__.py) to see how the runtime patching is done and [`bench.py`](bench.py) for an example.

_Install from source_ if your platform does not support `AVX2` instruction set as the PyPI packaged version assumes `AVX2` support.

## Installation

### Install from PyPI

`pip install lisbon`

### Install from source

- Make sure you have the Rust toolchain `rustc`, `cargo`, `rust-std` installed. The quickest way to do it is `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s`
  - For a minimal installation: `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --profile minimal`
- With your desired Python environment, `pip install maturin`
- Clone this repository and from `lisbon`'s project root, run `RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native' maturin develop --release` will install `lisbon` as a package to your Python environment
  - Note that the `RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native'` environmental variable ensures that rustc compiles against your CPU's supported instruction sets to enable more SIMD optimisations (e.g. AVX2, FMA).
- For dev/benchmark purposes, consider installing the packages listed in `requirements-dev.txt`

#### For Windows

To set the rustc flags on windows with powershell:
```powershell
$Env:RUSTFLAGS = "-C target-cpu=native"
maturin develop --release
```

## Limitations

`lisbon`'s speed up comes from vector instruction sets hence some platforms are not supported if not built from source.

Currently, `lisbon` only supports L2 regularised hinge loss and does not support

1. sample weights
2. class weights
3. different penalty `C` for labels
4. multiclass classification

## Deviations from the source implementation

1. As with `scikit-learn`'s modification, the order of labels are flipped to be consistent with the rest of the `scikit-learn` family
   - `liblinear` uses [+1, -1] ordering
   - `scikit-learn` uses [-1, +1] ordering
2. Uses a MT19937 + tweaked Lemire post-processor to generate a random number within range

## Why is lisbon faster

- `liblinear` uses sparse matrix representation for the dot/norm operations, so `scikit-learn` needs to convert the dense numpy matrix to sparse first then pass to liblinear. `lisbon` uses the dense matrix directly as sparse represented data can be inefficient and prevents some SIMD optimisations.
- By reading the numpy C array directly underneath thereâ€™s no need to copy/duplicate data which saves memory.
- Specialised. Some array reads and computations are optimised away as we know what the values are for the L2-regularised hinge loss binary classification routine.
